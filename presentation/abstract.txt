Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research's next generation software system that implements state-of-the-art object detection algorithms. It is a ground-up rewrite of the previous version, Detectron, and it originates from maskrcnn-benchmark and is fully powered by PyTorch in the form of an easily installable python module/wheel. Not only does it do localization and semantic segmentation, it also includes more features such as panoptic segmentation, densepose, Cascade R-CNN, rotated bounding boxes, etc. Released in late October of 2019, it is still relatively new and there are not a lot of pretrained models available for use in your research so this technical overview will show you how to create configuration files, setup your datasets, and train a network to use on your custom data, using ImageNet backbone as initialization. Being fast and reasonably lightweight, this is a great solution for doing object detectron, recognition, localization, and segmentation for all kinds of research projects that may need them in real-time with relatively minimal effort.
